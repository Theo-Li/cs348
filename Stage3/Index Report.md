    ```python
    meetings = Meeting.objects.filter(date='2024-12-01')
    ```
  - Sort meetings by date:
    ```python
    meetings = Meeting.objects.order_by('date')
    ```
  - Count meetings on a specific date:
    ```python
    meeting_count = Meeting.objects.filter(date='2024-12-01').count()
    ```
- **Optimization Reasons**:
  - **Date Query Optimization**: Improves the performance of date-based filtering and sorting, supporting the generation of date-classified reports and views.

## 6. Index: `Meeting(date, club)`

- **Index Type**: Composite Index (`date`, `club`)
- **Supported Queries**:
  - Filter meetings by date and club:
    ```python
    meetings = Meeting.objects.filter(date__gte='2024-11-01', date__lte='2024-11-15', club=club_instance)
    ```
- **Optimization Reasons**:
  - **Multi-Condition Query Optimization**: Enhances the performance of filtering based on both date and club, supporting complex reporting and statistical analysis needs.

## 7. Index: `Meeting.duration`

- **Index Type**: B-tree Index
- **Supported Queries**:
  - Find meetings with duration exceeding a specific value:
    ```python
    meetings = Meeting.objects.filter(duration__gte=timedelta(hours=2))
    ```
- **Optimization Reasons**:
  - **Duration Query Optimization**: Increases the efficiency of duration-based queries, supporting time management and resource allocation functionalities.

## 8. Index: `Meeting.invited_count` and `Meeting.accepted_count`

- **Index Type**: Composite Index (`invited_count`, `accepted_count`)
- **Supported Queries**:
  - Generate statistical reports on invited and accepted counts:
    ```python
    report = Meeting.objects.aggregate(
        average_invited=Avg('invited_count'),
        average_accepted=Avg('accepted_count')
    )
    ```
- **Optimization Reasons**:
  - **Report Generation Optimization**: Accelerates aggregation calculations based on invited and accepted counts, enhancing the performance and responsiveness of report generation.

## 9. Index: `MeetingOrganizer.meeting` and `MeetingOrganizer.student`

- **Index Type**: Composite Index (`meeting`, `student`)
- **Supported Queries**:
  - Find organizers for a specific meeting:
    ```python
    organizers = MeetingOrganizer.objects.filter(meeting=meeting_instance)
    ```
  - Find meetings organized by a specific student:
    ```python
    meetings = MeetingOrganizer.objects.filter(student=student_instance)
    ```
- **Optimization Reasons**:
  - **Query Efficiency**: Speeds up joint queries involving both meeting and student fields, enhancing the performance of organizer management.
